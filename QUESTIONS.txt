OOP design of a jigsaw puzzle. Imagine you want to solve a rectangular jigsaw puzzle. What classes and relationships do you need? Design an algo for solving the actual puzzle
More like a design question. Given a Piece class and a Side class, design a method solve(pieces[]) which returns a solved puzzle. I had to design the data structure for solved puzzle and how I would write the solve method.
Program an ASCII printer. I think this was OOP related question which I thought is as simple as ''.join(str(ord(c)) for c in s)
Design a jigsaw puzzle algorithm, given a Piece class, a Side class containing sideTypes, and a helper function which returns whether or not two pieces are a match
